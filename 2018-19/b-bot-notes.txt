HARDWARE OVERVIEW

6 wheels, each with own motor (leftFront, LeftRear etc.)   - digital motor ports 1-3 and 8-10
1 additional motor to drive the cap flipper

FOR THE BALL LAUNCHER

	2 motors for right fly wheels, with splitter cable.   - digital motor port 6
	2 motors for left fly wheels, with splitter cable.   - digital motor port 5
	1 motor for conveyor, digital port 4


All motors so far are 2-wire so require D/A adapter to connect to digital motor ports



Analog 1 connects to potentionmeter used to provide "course selection" choice in autonomous.
Analog 2 connects to gyro 
ISC connects to encoder on one of the left moters and an encoder on one of the right models.

SENSORS



Sensor 1: Potentiometer:  range:     

Sensor 2: Gryo output: 

Sensor 3: limit switch


CODING OVERVIEW

Where possible, repeated code (e.g. for direction or turning control) will be in own function.    This is to minimize the amount of duplicated code in the autonomous loops.

User Control Loop -   used to set remote control functions 
Autonomous Loop -   based to POT position will call either AutonomousA or AutonomousB 


The cap flipper is on the back end of the robot.  This means in many cases robot will be driving in reverse.  
The original design plans had called for the front end to have the ball launcher,
while the backend would include the intial scoop mechanism.
